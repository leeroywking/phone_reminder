Hey lovie, I know you thought life would be different and maybe you thought you would be in a different place now. But there is more that determines our life journey than the choices we make and you’ve made the best choices you could so far. Don’t give up. I love you and we need you here. - Katie

Sensitivity is a sign of life. Better hurt than hardened. I bow to those who keep their hearts open when it is most difficult, those who refuse to keep their armor on any longer than they have to, those who recognize the courage at the heart of vulnerability. After all the misguided warriors destroy each other, the open-hearted will inherit the earth. - Stitch
Forgive yourself for not knowing better at the time. Forgive yourself for giving away your power. Forgive yourself for past behaviors. Forgive yourself for the survival patterns and traits you picked up while enduring trauma. Forgive yourself for being who you needed to be at the time. - Faith
